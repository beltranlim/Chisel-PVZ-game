# Chisel-PVZ-game
A simple 2D arcade game built using Chisel HDL during my summer exchange at DTU.
# Chisel Arcade Game

A 2D arcade game implemented using Chisel HDL, developed during my NUS summer exchange program.  
This project explores how hardware design principles can be applied to interactive game logic,  
bridging the gap between digital design and real-world applications.

## Features
- Implemented game logic in Chisel
- Real-time interaction using FPGA board
- Demonstrates low-level hardware-software integration


## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Run with sbt
3. Deploy to FPGA for hardware testing
